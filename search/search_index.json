Wa fawakiha... Similarly many similarities are mentioned like this in this way, of this type in the full Quraan and it is preferable that we apply a rule to uplift this difficulty RULE 1)When the (surah name) is singular Example: Surah Yaseen, Saad, Zukhruf, Toor, Rahman, Waqiah Mentions fakiha (Singular word) 2)when the name of surah is plural Example :Surah Moominoon, Safaat, Mursalat Mentions fawakiha (Plural word) Information of Quraan: How do we differentiate between. \"yosabbihu\" and \"sabbaha\" at the beginning of suraahs and how do we know which one to start with? When the first letter of the Surah name has a dot on it - will be \"yusabbihu\" When first letter of surah name doesn't have a dot on it will be \"sabbaha\" Example:Surah Hadeed starts with Haa and letter Haa has no dots in it, so surah will begin with \"sabbaha\" Surah Taghabun starts with Taa and it has a dot in it so it will be \"yusabbihu\" May Allah grant me and you the ability of memorising the holy Quraan and its recital and May peace and salutations be sent on Mohammad (S. A. W) and his family and all companions. AMEEN \ud83d\udc90 Question : what is the 7 \"fives\" in the Quraan. Answer : to simplify the beginnings of the surah of Quraan there are these \"fives\" Split in 7 - 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 (7) \ud83d\udd34 1)First type - 5 Surah that starts with praise Fatiha Ana'am Kahf Saba Fatir All Makki Surahs (Sent down in Makkah) \ud83d\udd34 2)Second type- 5 surah that starts with praise of Allah Hadeed Hashar Saff Jummah Taghabun All Madni Surahs (Sent down in Madina) \ud83d\udd34 3)Third type - 5 surah which begin with Alim and Raa Yunus Huud Yusuf Ibrahim Hijr All are Makki surah \ud83d\udd34 4) Fourth type- 5 Surah that starts with call Nisaa Maida Hajj Hujrat Mumtahina All are Madni \ud83d\udd34 5)Fifth type- 5 Surah which start with the call of prophet (S. A. W) Ahzaab Atalaq Tahreen Muzammil Muddathir All are Madni \ud83d\udd34 6)Sixth type - 5 surah which start with Questioning Insaan Ghashiya Alan Nashrah Feel Maoon All are Makki Surahs \ud83d\udd34 7)Seventh type- 5 Surah which start with an order of Qul(Say) Jin Kafiroon Ikhlaas Falaq *Naas All are Makki Surahs \ud83d\udd34 \ud83d\udc90Benifit others with this \ud83d\udc90 May Allah reward the writer and spreader and reader and receiver for any benifit gained And Allah forgive his/her parents and our parents and your children and the whole Muslim umaah alive or dead.

What a comparison. Subhanallah!!... I didn't write this but felt it is worth sharing! \" Quite amazing Also see: related Nouman Ali Khan video <- Comparision of Musa AS and Yousuf AS Things I have noticed while reflecting on the story of Yusuf (A.S) & to the story of Musa (A.S), while comparing Sura Yusuf and Sura Qasas. I thought it is beneficial to share. The story of Yusuf makes you wonder why the mom was never mentioned; the story of Musa makes you wonder why the dad was never mentioned. Yusuf story begins with the interaction between father and son; Musa story begins with the interaction between mother and son In Yusuf story, his siblings were the reason Yusuf got separated from his family; In Musa story, his sibling was the reason Musa got reunited with his family In Yusuf story, the siblings convinced their dad INTELLECTUALLY to let go of Yusuf; In Musa story, Allah convinced the mom EMOTIONALLY to let go of Musa In Yusuf story, the dad (who IS a prophet) was NEVER told if he will ever reunite with his son; in Musa story, the mom (who is NOT a prophet) was told that she WILL reunite with her son In Yusuf story, the dad cries tears of sadness; in Musa story, the mom cries tears of happiness Yusuf got dumped in a standing water (well); Musa got dumped in a flowing water (River) Yusuf was brought to his new house by a male figure (Egypt\u2019s minister); Musa was brought to his new house by a female figure (Pharaoh\u2019s wife) In Yusuf story, the minister told his wife to either take him as a slave or as an adopted son; In Musa story, pharaoh\u2019s wife told her husband to either take him as a slave or as an adopted son In Yusuf story, I expected the minister\u2019s wife to take Yusuf as a son, because they never had kids, but he was taken as a slave instead; In Musa story, I expected the pharaoh to take Musa as a slave, because he was an Israelite, but he was taken as an adopted son instead Yusuf\u2019s life changed from a life of dignity to a life of slavery; Musa\u2019s life changed from a life of slavery to a life of dignity In Sura Yusuf, Allah mentions that he gave Yusuf wisdom and knowledge; in Sura Qasas, Allah mentions that he gave Musa wisdom and knowledge Yusuf was also given an exceptional trait (Looks); Musa was also given an exceptional trait (Strength) Yusuf got into trouble with the Minister\u2019s wife because of his exceptional trait (looks); Musa got into trouble with the authority because of his exceptional trait (strength) The crime that was about to happen to Yusuf was private in nature; the crime that happened to Musa was public in nature The crime that was about to happen to Yusuf was the killing of a soul (Zina); The crime that happened to Musa was the killing of a body (murder) Yusuf sought refuge of Allah before the crime happened; Musa sought refuge of Allah after the crime happened Yusuf, who was innocent, ended up getting detained by the law; Musa, who was guilty, ended up fleeing the law Yusuf, while in Jail, was approached by 2 men; Musa, while fleeing, approaches 2 women Yusuf\u2019s story continues with only one man; Musa\u2019s story continues with only one woman In Yusuf\u2019s story, Allah teaches us how a man and a woman should NOT come together; In Musa\u2019s story, Allah teaches us how a man and a woman SHOULD come together In Yusuf\u2019s story, an EXPECTED friend got him out of his trial (Jail) after YEARS; In Musa\u2019s story, an UNEXPECTED friend got him out of his trial (being killed) after DAYS In Yusuf\u2019s story, we learn that his friend came to help him because of a SELFISH reason (he wanted to be acknowledged by the King for the interpretation of the King\u2019s dream); in Musa\u2019s story, we learn that his friend came to help him because of a SELFLESS reason (he was afraid that Musa will be killed by the authorities) Yusuf helps out the 2 cell-mates by giving Da\u2019wah to them (The power of words); Musa helps out the 2 women by feeding their sheep (The power of action) In Yusuf\u2019s story, Yusuf expected a favor from his cell-mate, but it did not come immediately; In Musa\u2019s story, Musa did not expect a favor from the 2 women, but it came immediately Yusuf returns to the court and faces the King; Musa returns to the court and faces the King In Yusuf\u2019s story, a confession happens (the women who wronged Yusuf admitted their faults); In Musa\u2019s story, a confession happens (Musa himself admitted his fault) Yusuf gets honored by the King; Musa gets humiliated by the King In Yusuf story, we learn that Yusuf got reunited with his brother (Benjamin); In Musa story, we learn that Musa got reunited with his brother (Haroon) In Sura Yusuf, Benjamin remained silent; In Sura Qasas, Haroon remained silent In Yusuf story, there was a Sajdah (Yusuf\u2019s family prostrating themselves after being reunited); In Musa\u2019s story, there was a Sajdah (The magicians who lost to Musa) The story of Yusuf answers the question of how the Israelites came to Egypt; The story of Musa answers the question of how the Israelites left Egypt.Allahu Akbar.\" . . . . .","title":"Yusuf AS vs. Musa AS story comparison"},{"location":"articles/dua%20-%20An%20absolute%20must%20dua%20for%20Tahadjud%20this%20Ramadaan/","text":"An absolute must dua for Tahadjud this Ramadaan for all parents world over The Powerful Dua of a Parent: In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful, All praises are for Allah (SWT), the most Compassionate, the most Forgiving.
